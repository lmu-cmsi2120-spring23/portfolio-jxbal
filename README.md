# Guidelines

In _Data Structures & Applications_, as much or more than in any other class, there are a ton of different ways to get where we need to go. Moreover, we all have different prior experiences and learning-related preferences. Try everything and keep track of your progress here.

Each assignment or project you work on can have its own group with pages and subpages for each part of the work. Guidelines for pages and subpages:

* Each "classwork" assignment is meant to help you practice one thing at a time. No need for more than one page per classwork. Homework projects on the other hand are designed to combine multiple concepts and competencies, so you may have subpages for different parts of a project.&#x20;
* Include a description of your process: What did you do and learn? Where did you get stuck? Who or where did you find help? If you worked in a group, how did you manage division of labor and what were your specific contributions?
* Include a link to the GitHub repo for code and documentation. When you go to _Insert Subpage_ you have options to insert a new document page or a new link.

## Becoming a Java developer

{% hint style="success" %}
**Learning outcome:** gain experience with an enterprise programming language (Java), advanced topics in object-oriented programming, software development best practices, and test-driven development.
{% endhint %}

Corresponding assignments

* Classworks 0, 1, 2
* Java bootcamp
* _Philosophy of Software Design_ by John Ousterhout

{% hint style="success" %}
**Learning outcome:** gain a deeper understanding of class hierarchies and inheritance, object-oriented programming, and implementing and applying data structures programmatically.
{% endhint %}

* Projects

## All things data structures

{% hint style="success" %}
**Learning outcome:** be introduced to a wide range of Data Structures and Abstract Data Types (ADTs), learning which are best suited for which tasks, including: lists, stacks, queues, heaps, priority queues, hash tables, sets, maps, trees, search trees, tries, and graphs.
{% endhint %}

* LeetCode practice problems
* Classworks 2–6

{% hint style="success" %}
**Learning outcome:** learn the interfaces for popular Java collections, and how to use them in a variety of non-trivial programming tasks.
{% endhint %}

* LeetCode practice problems

## Analysis and design

{% hint style="success" %}
**Learning outcome:** understand analytic programming concepts such as asymptotics, time-complexity, and space-complexity, i.e., that not all programs are created equal–two programs that perform the same task may not do so with the same efficiency or cleanliness.
{% endhint %}

* Classwork 6
* Finding & understanding efficient solutions for LeetCode problems (not just solving them)

## Participation & engagement

Keep a log of your participation in class community spaces. This doesn't have to be a perfect record, it just gives us some data to review together at check-ins. Not everyone needs to have a ton of participation of all types, but ideally there will be some of each. You can decide what works for you.&#x20;

## Reflections

Every 3 weeks, write a few paragraphs about what you've been working on and learning. Write about your process, a sort of behind-the-scenes reel for each project or assignment.
